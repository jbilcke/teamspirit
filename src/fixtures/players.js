    "strDescriptionEN":"Henrikh Mkhitaryan  born 21 January 1989) is an Armenian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for English club Arsenal, as well as captaining the Armenia national team. Mkhitaryan is Armenia's all-time top goalscorer, scoring 19 goals in 59 international matches since his debut in January 2007, including their first hat-trick. His previous clubs include Pyunik, where he came through the youth system, Metalurh Donetsk, Shakhtar Donetsk and Borussia Dortmund.\r\n\r\nMkhitaryan has been chosen Armenian Footballer of the Year five times (every year since 2009, except 2010). In 2012 he was voted as the best Shakhtar player of 2011–12 season by the fans, and Ukraine Premier League MVP. In 2012, Mkhitaryan was named in UEFA's Top 100 players by UEFA European Football Yearbook 2012–13. Mkhitaryan was voted the CIS Footballer of the Year for 2012, making him the first Armenian footballer to be named the best player from post-Soviet countries. He received the award again for 2013. Mkhitaryan received the nickname Heno from his fans in Armenia and has been nicknamed Micki by his Borussia Dortmund fans.\r\n\r\nMkhitaryan was born on 21 January 1989 in the Armenian capital Yerevan to Marina Taschyan and Hamlet Mkhitaryan, a prominent striker of FC Ararat Yerevan during the 1980s, who died of a brain tumor at age 33 when Mkhitaryan was seven years old. His mother is the head of the national teams department in the Armenian Football Federation and his elder sister, Monica, works at UEFA's headquarters.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, the Mkhitaryan family moved to France, where Hamlet Mkhitaryan played for the now defunct ASOA Valence and helped them to be promoted to the second division Ligue 2. Mkhitaryan spent his early childhood in Valence. He always wanted to become a football player and began to follow in his father's footsteps. As a child, he would watch his father play and always wanted to follow him to training. The Mkhitaryans returned to Yerevan in 1995. In the same year Mkhitaryan joined the youth system of FC Pyunik. He graduated from the Institute of Physical Culture in Armenia. He studied economics at the Yerevan branch of the St. Petersburg Institute. Upon graduation, he plans to study there as a lawyer. In 2003, Mkhitaryan, aged 14 had trials with São Paulo in Brazil where he played alongside the likes of Hernanes and Oscar. He returned back to Pyunik in 2004, then manager Mihai Stoichiță insisted on his return to Armenia. Growing up, Mkhitaryan considered Zinedine Zidane his football idol.\r\n\r\nMkhitaryan is an attacking midfielder capable of playing second striker as well. He thrives playing just behind the strikers, where he always looks to link up with his teammates in and around the box. Tearing apart opposition defences time and time again, he makes space for the striker/wingers to exploit and create goal scoring opportunities. Mkhitaryan has been praised for his technique, movement, accurate passing, dribbling, creativity, ball control and work rate. He is equipped with a dangerous shot, trickery to beat defenders, and a superb vision to go for the pass.\r\n\r\nDuring the 2012–13 season, former Scottish footballer Pat Nevin said of Mkhitaryan, \"Eleven goals in eight league matches already is fantastic, but when you add that he is a midfielder, it is phenomenal. You may not have heard of him yet, even if all the scouts at the top European clubs have, but you soon will. He has pace, skill, a rocket of a shot and the ability to arrive in the box like Frank Lampard. This all singles him out as a player who must be watched or more importantly marked.\"",

    "strDescriptionEN":"Granit Xhaka (Albanian pronunciation: ; born 27 September 1992) is a Swiss professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for English club Arsenal and the Switzerland national team. Swiss national manager Ottmar Hitzfeld once dubbed him the \"young Schweinsteiger\", while former Arsenal defender Johan Djourou has praised his tackling, versatility, and physicality.\r\n\r\nXhaka began his career at hometown club Basel, winning the Swiss Super League in both of his seasons. He then moved to Bundesliga team Borussia Mönchengladbach in 2012, playing 140 official games and scoring nine goals.\r\n\r\nHe has been a full international for Switzerland since 2011, gaining more than 40 caps. He was included in their squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016.\r\n\r\nXhaka was born in Basel, Switzerland to Kosovo Albanian parents and is the younger brother of Taulant Xhaka, who is also a professional footballer and plays for the Albania national football team and played against Granit in the second Euro 2016 match. Their family moved from Kosovo to Switzerland shortly before their children were born.\r\n\r\nThe brothers started their youth football by Concordia Basel and both moved to Basel in 2002. Xhaka played for various Basel youth teams and since 2008 has been a member of the U-21 squad. Between 2008 and 2010 he played 37 games for the U-21 team, scoring eleven goals.\r\n\r\nBefore making his international debut for Switzerland, Xhaka was still undecided whether to play for his birth country or Albania, and he complained to the Albanian sports media that FSHF was ignoring him while the Swiss Football Association was showing much more interest.\r\n\r\nXhaka debuted for Switzerland at Wembley Stadium against England, in a 2–2 UEFA Euro 2012 qualification draw on 4 June 2011. On 15 November of the same year, during his sixth international appearance, he scored his first international goal in the 1–0 away win against Luxembourg in Stade Josy Barthel.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland also tried to select him to participate in the 2012 Olympic Football tournament, but he opted to stay at his new club for pre-season training. Xhaka participated in all ten of Switzerland's 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign matches, scoring both goals in a 2–0 defeat of Slovenia.\r\n\r\nOn 2 June 2014, Xhaka was named in Switzerland's 2014 FIFA World Cup squad by national coach Ottmar Hitzfeld. In the team's second match, Xhaka scored in a 5–2 loss to France.\r\n\r\nXhaka was selected for UEFA Euro 2016, where Switzerland's campaign opened against Albania in Lens. Xhaka, whose team won 1–0, was playing against his own brother while their mother watched from the crowd in a t-shirt blending the two nations' flags. He was voted the man of the match. Xhaka played every minute of Switzerland's campaign, which ended in the last 16 with a loss to Poland at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard; after a 1–1 draw he was the only player to not score in the penalty shootout, shooting wide.",

Kolašinac's stay at Stuttgart was short-lived, and a season later, he joined Schalke 04.\r\n\r\nKolašinac is regarded as a defensive all-rounder which means that he can be deployed in multiple defensive positions. In Kolašinac's Schalke 04 II career, he was deployed mostly as a centre back or defensive midfielder. Schalke head coach Jens Keller has primarily deployed Kolašinac as a left full-back; a playing position in which Kolašinac has received praise. Kolašinac is deemed to be physically strong and tough in his physique, clever defensively on the pitch and defensively consistent in winning one-on-one duels against his opponents.\r\n\r\nKolašinac was born in Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, to Bosniak parents. His father, Faik, works at a Mercedes-Benz factory. Faik was born in Nikšić, SR Montenegro, to parents from Plav, SR Montenegro; the family moved to Čapljina, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1969, where Faik met his wife.

    "strDescriptionEN":"Lucas Sebastián Torreira Di Pascua (born 11 February 1996) is a Uruguayan footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder for Premier League club Arsenal and the Uruguay national team.\r\n\r\nClub career\r\nTorreira started his youth football career at hometown club I.A. 18 de Julio of Fray Bentos. In 2013, he joined Montevideo Wanderers' youth team, he then moved to Italy where he joined Pescara's youth team.\r\n\r\nPescara\r\n\r\nTorreira playing for Pescara in 2014\r\nBefore the 2014–15 season, Torreira was called up for Pescara's first team and, on 25 October 2014, he sat on the bench for the first time. He made his senior debut in Serie B on 16 May 2015 against Varese, playing the game in the starting line-up. In this game, he played 58 minutes before he was replaced with Matteo Politano. He played five games including promotion playoffs in the season.\r\n\r\nSampdoria\r\nOn 1 July 2015, Torreira transferred to Sampdoria for €1.5 million, but he remained with Pescara on loan for the 2015–16 season to gain first-team experience.\r\n\r\nPescara (loan)\r\nOn 2 July 2015, he was loaned to Pescara. On 9 August 2015, Torreira scored his first professional goal against F.C. Südtirol in the 2015–16 Coppa Italia. He played 26 games and scored three league goals. He also played three games and scored one goal in the promotion playoffs.\r\n\r\nReturn to Sampdoria\r\nAfter the Pescara loan expired, the player returned to Sampdoria on 1 July 2016. On 21 August 2016, Torreira made his Serie A debut in their opening game against Empoli at the Stadio Carlo Castellani. He started the game and played the entirety of the 90+ minutes on the field.\r\n\r\nHe became a regular for Sampdoria in the 2016–17 season, and continued showing his importance to the team in the 2017–18 season; scoring vital goals, including the second goal in Sampdoria's 3–2 win over Juventus in November.\r\n\r\nArsenal\r\nAfter a summer of speculation, Torreira joined English club Arsenal on 10 July 2018 for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around £26.4m. Upon the completion of the signing, head coach Unai Emery said \"In Lucas Torreira, we have signed a young player who is a very bright talent in the game. A midfielder with great quality, I have enjoyed watching his performances for Sampdoria in the past two seasons, and we all saw him do very well for Uruguay in the World Cup. He is a young player already with good experience, but who wants to keep on growing.\" Torreira was given the number 11 shirt, previously worn by Mesut Özil, who took the vacant number 10, following the departure of Jack Wilshere.\r\n\r\nInternational career\r\nTorreira was called up to full Uruguay squad for the 2018 China Cup in March 2018. He made his debut in the 2–0 win over the Czech Republic in the China Cup semi final.\r\n\r\nIn May 2018 he was named in Uruguay's provisional 26 man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.\r\n\r\nStyle of play\r\nUpon signing for Arsenal in 2018, The Independent's Jack Austin stated \"Torreira is exactly the kind of no-nonsense midfielder the club have been craving\", adding that in Uruguay colours during the 2018 World Cup \"he went about his job as the deep-lying pivot in the middle of the park with none of the fuss and all of the discipline of a player who has built a tidy reputation for himself in Serie A\", while assessing his chief weaknesses as a lack of height in aerial duels and little goal threat.",
